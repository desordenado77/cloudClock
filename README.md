cloudClock
==========
This repository contains the code for my arduino yun based alarm clock project. More info here: http://how-i-did-that.blogspot.com



Folder Structure
================

Arduino: This has the arduino sketch.
Linino: This folder has the python script that will be run on the linino side. The files there should be copied into the folder /root/cloudClock/ in the linino root filesystem.
Schematic: This file has the schematic of the project. Other than what can be found there, a usb audio interface is also required.



Usage
=====

The menu on the LCD screen is browsed using the rotary encoder. Rotating the shaft is used to move through the menu options, single press is for select and long press is for going back.
